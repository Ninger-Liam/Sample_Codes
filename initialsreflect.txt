Starting initials wasn't really that hard to do, the usual procedure of getting the user to respond to the prompt, but from that point on I was absolutely clueless on what to do. I studied those videos and rewatched them over and over again, trying to understand how strings worked and how the islower and toupper functions worked. But even after that I was still lost on how to print just the initials. I figured out how to make the text all uppercase always no matter how the user put the entered the string case wise by useing the toupper function. Eventually I googled another youtube video on strings and figured out how to check for certain characters in the stringand not just the whole string. After that it all became clear to me. I made it so that the code will always print out the first letter of the srting capitalized, but then created a for loop with an if statment inside of it. All the if statement checks for is the space inbetween the two names. If the character is the space, the program will print the next character afterwards uppercase, making the computer only printing the initials of the name.
