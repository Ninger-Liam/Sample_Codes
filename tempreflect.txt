I find javascript to be kind of easy, although I find myself struggling to retaining some of the functions or
phrases in order to make the code run properly. But besides that, I feel that my prior experience with C helps me
program a lot of these projects in javascript. One of the things in javascript that I have to get used to is using
the .value function for variables. The biggest struggle I had when programming temperature was that I was missing the
.value function after the input and choice variables. I kept reading my code over and over because I couldn't figure
out why it wasn't working. Once I read over the problem I realized that the only thing that was wrong with it was
that I forgot the .value for those variables, everything came together. I realized afterwards that I still needed
some checks that would make sure that the user is firstly actually entering something into the converter
and secondly making sure that what the user types in is actually a number with no other characters.
After that I got a little bored waiting to do the skittles project and added a little extra css to spice things up.
