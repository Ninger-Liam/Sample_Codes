          Each stoop is unique in the fact that they all have their own essence.
          The big dog on the block is the one closest to Greenwich Ave, everyone is always packed around that stoop.
          And there’s the really quiet one across the street that screams “old people love me”.
          My stoop, on the other hand, is different from other stoops.
          It’s not the super pretty stoops that you see in SoHo or Tribeca, it’s not the popular stoops that everyone goes to (that’s the stoop two buildings down from mine).
          It’s not the really sketchy stoop that you always take a double-take at when you pass by it, and it’s not the brand new stoop that always seems to catch your eye.
          Somehow though, this stoop is a stoop that both people old and new to the neighborhood are happy to call part of their home.</p>

            This ragged little stoop that I call my own isn’t something that everyone would think is that nice because of this, and if I’m being honest it’s seen better days.
            I used to have a brighter glow to it once in some summer morning in 2008.
            There used to be a gate that would swing open and shut that four-year-old me would blissfully swing on everytime, but that was eleven years ago.
            Now the gate has rusted over and fallen off, parts of the concrete have become chipped and jagged due to construction, and nine times out of ten you’ll find someone’s Van Leween ice cream cup lying on the steps.
            Despite all of this, it still maintains a glow that’s reminiscent to which it once had then, but now coming out with a new purpose.</p></td>
