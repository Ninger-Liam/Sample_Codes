Write your reflection here

In Mario, I started off by creating a massive array of for loops to print each row individually. This worked for the first part of the project because the pyramid would be successfully left aligned for each height that the user would input. My struggle arose when I had to make the pyramid aligned towards the right. While I was making some progress making the pyramid right aligned, I was later informed that I was tackling the problem in the wrong way and that I was supposed to use a nested for loop. While I was a little unsure of how it worked, I combined some of my work with the code that was shown in one of the hints and I was back to a left aligned pyramid. I really struggled getting this pyramid right aligned. At one point I accidentally made a forever loop and my terminal went crazy. I was stuck knowing what I wanted to do but unsure how to do it. eventually someone gave me a hint for the formula to get it right aligned and I immediatly felt like an idiot when I figured it out. It was so basic yet I was so worried about getting it wrong that I second guessed every idea I had. I eventually used a nested for loop containing an if- else statement. the outer loop contained a variable to keep track of how many rows had been made compared to the height given by the user and the inner loop keeping track of how many hashtags needed to be printed for each row. The if-else statment determined if a space needed to be printed or a hashtag. And this code works for any height beetween 1 and 8 because of the do while loop prompting the user for the height at the top.
