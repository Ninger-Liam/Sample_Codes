It used to be a lot more dangerous, but the community was a lot closer with each other because of it. Now itâ€™s cleaned up its act, and drawn the attention of a lot of NYU students, but hidden beneath this new identity lies aspects of what used to be. Take one stroll down the block and from dawn to dusk one thing is always true: someone is sitting on their stoop.</p>';
