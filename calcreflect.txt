In calc I started with figuring out the pseudo code for the problem, which essentially was determine the numbers that were being used and determine which character was being used for the operation and performing that operation through code and printing out the results of the calculation. Which seems pretty simple, because it is for the most part. One of the main problems I encountered was checking for the character of the operation because simply putting argv[2] doesn't work. I belive it doesn't work because the if statment is checking for an individual character, but argv[2]'s data is stored as a string, even though in this case it's only one character long. Since the if statment is checking for an individual character instead of a string, putting argv[2] is incorrect, and you have to specify which character you want the if statment to check. To correct this, I had to put argv[2][0], which now is checking for an individual character instead of the whole string. Lastly, for the longest time my check50 was showing errors even though my calculations were coming out as correct when I input them. Overhearing a conversation Chris and Tenzing were having about the libraries for Fahrenheit, I realized I forgot to include stdlib.h into the program. Once I did that, everything was complete.
