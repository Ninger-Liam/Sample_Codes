As soon as Ms Tanzosh brought up the project to the class I immediately knew what I wanted to do for my webpage, even though I would inevitably end up falling pretty short from where I wanted my webpage to be. What I didnâ€™t know however, is that what I wanted to do for my webpage would be giving me a headstart in JavaScript, once again putting me ahead of schedule in class. Most of my time was devoted to my homepage because this is where most of the magic happened. What I wanted was a big button in the middle of the webpage which when clicked would create a nice transition for the rest of my page to load in. I soon discovered that transitions are REALLY hard, and the dial-up speeds of the ide servers pretty much add their own transition to the page anyways. It took me a long time figuring out how to do that though, I tried a few different methods in attempts to remove just one button from my webpage. I used the remove() method, the delete() method, and my personal favorite, the removeChild() method. None of these methods worked. What did end up working was with my on click function, appear, I was able to make the button disappear, which essentially deletes the button the page, and then made my navigation bar appear, while also using JavaScript to add a background image and text to my page. After figuring that out, the rest of my website was essentially copying and pasting my HTML code onto the other pages while changing things like the format and the content to fit the theme of each page.
