When reading the problem descripiton for caesar, it seemed simple enough. Get the key in the command line, prompt the user for a string, and shift the string over by the key % 26. But in practice this was actually a lot harder than it seemed. The biggest oversight I ran into with this problem was the ASCII code. There's about a 32 character difference between 'Z' and 'a', and those 32 characters aren't alphabetical numbers at all. I had to do some googleing on how to convret the characters from ASCII to the alphabetical index. After that I realized I had to use for loops and had to check the capitalization of each character in order to properly encrypt it. The for loop was set to be as long as the string length using strlen, and inside the for loop are a bunch of if else staments. The main if stament checks if the caharacter is an alphabetical character with the function isalpha. Inside of that are two if statments. The first one checks if the character is capitalized by using the isupper function. If it meets that condition, you subtract 65, which is the ASCII code for 'A', add the key, mod 26 the char and then add 65 again. The next if stament is very similar, it checks if the char is lowercased using the function islower (although in hindsight I realize this is redundant). and the algorithm is the same except that we subtract by 97, because that's tha ASCII code for 'a'. If none of these conditions are met, the program just prints the char as normal. Towards the end of my project I found that my algorithm wasn't wuite working, so I asked a friend for help and submitted it their way, altough I still wwasn't sure why mine wasn't working because it was basically their algorithm except with more variables. Ms Tanzosh would later show me that I forgot to include my key into the algorithm.
